Dockerfile for [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) with [Hexo Admin](https://github.com/jaredly/hexo-admin)

The image is available directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spurin/hexo/)

A tutorial is available at [spurin.com](https://spurin.com/old/2020/01/04/Creating-a-Blog-Website-with-Docker-Hexo-Github-Free-Hosting-and-HTTPS/)

Latest version updates the node version from 13-slim to 20-bullseye.

## TODO AND NOTICE: 

Now the default Dockerfile is still root user for compatible issue for **server maintainers**, especially for those whose server **have no non-root user**. But you should migrate to non-root version if you are a **PC user**, for it is secure and convenient to edit files in app volume. BUT migrating to non-root version directly will surely **CAUSE COMPATIBLE ISSUES**, so read the description page.

If you currently want to run one, build an image yourself. I will push it to Dockerhub and change the description there as soon as possible so that you can pull from there:

```
docker build -t hexo:nonroot -f hexo_nonroot.Dockerfile .
```
Later, you can pull from dockerhub.


## Getting Started

### ROOT MODE (DEFAULT)

Create a new blog container, substitute *domain.com* for your domain and specify your blog location with -v target:/app, specify your git user and email address (for deployment):

```
docker create --name=hexo-domain.com \
-e HEXO_SERVER_PORT=4000 \
-e GIT_USER="Your Name" \
-e GIT_EMAIL="your.email@domain.tld" \
-v /blog/domain.com:/app \
-p 4000:4000 \
spurin/hexo
```

If a blog is not configured in /app (locally as /blog/domain.com) yet, it will be created and Hexo-Admin will be installed into the blog as the container is started

```
docker start hexo-domain.com
```


### NON-ROOT MODE (PC USERS)

Create a new blog container, substitute *domain.com* for your domain and specify your blog location with -v target:/home/node/app, specify your git user and email address (for deployment):

```
mkdir -p ~/blog/domain.com

docker create --name=hexo-domain.com \
-e HEXO_SERVER_PORT=4000 \
-e GIT_USER="Your Name" \
-e GIT_EMAIL="your.email@domain.tld" \
-v ~/blog/domain.com:/home/node/app \
-p 4000:4000 \
spurin/hexo:nonroot
```

If a blog is not configured in /home/node/app (locally as ~/blog/domain.com) yet, it will be created and Hexo-Admin will be installed into the blog as the container is started

```
docker start hexo-domain.com
```

## Accessing the container

Should you wish to perform further configuration, i.e. installing custom themes, this should be viable from the app specific volume, either directly or via the container (changes to the app volume are persistent).  Accessing the container -

```
docker exec -it hexo-domain.com bash
```

## Deployment keys for use with Github/Gitlab

Deployment keys are configured as part of the initial app configuration, see the .ssh directory within your app volume or, view the logs upon startup for the SSH public key

```
docker logs --follow hexo-domain.com
```

## Installing a theme

Each theme will vary but for example, a theme such as [Hueman](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-hueman), clone the repository to the themes directory within the app volume

### Execute inside container

Run this commmand line to access the container:

```
docker exec -it hexo-domain.com bash
```

Inside the container:

```
cd /app
git clone https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-hueman.git themes/hueman
```

Update _config.yml in your app folder, and change theme accordingly

```
theme: hueman
```

Enable the default configuration

```
mv themes/hueman/_config.yml.example themes/hueman/_config.yml
```

Exit the container

```
exit
```

And restart the container

```
docker restart hexo-domain.com
```


### Execute outside container (non-root version only)

Non-root access is the key feature of this update so that you can control your app volume outside the container, steps are quite the similar but more convenient:

```
cd ~/blog/domain.com
git clone https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-hueman.git themes/hueman
```

Update _config.yml in your app folder, and change theme accordingly

```
theme: hueman
```

Enable the default configuration

```
mv themes/hueman/_config.yml.example themes/hueman/_config.yml
```

And restart the container

```
docker restart hexo-domain.com
```

It is OK to follow the similar way as in the default version before, by just replacing `cd /app` with `cd /home/node/app`.

## Accessing Hexo

Access the default hexo blog interface at `http://< ip_address >:4000`

If you are a PC user, visit `localhost:4000`

## Accessing Hexo-Admin

Access Hexo-Admin at `http://< ip_address >:4000/admin`

PC user, `localhost:4000`

## Generating Content

```
docker exec -it hexo-domain.com hexo generate
```

## Deploying Generated Content

```
docker exec -it hexo-domain.com hexo deploy
```

## Adding hexo plugins

If you wish to add specific hexo plugins, add them to a requirements.txt file to your app volume, for example (app/requirements.txt) -

```
hexo-generator-json-content
```

During startup, if the requirements.txt file exists, requirements are auto installed
